### About Me

I have always been interested in programming and this is why I have chosen to study Computer Science in BIT. Unfortunately, I just started learning coding and programming last semester and I do not have a very good foundation for them. Despite not being very strong in programming, I'm striving to learn more about it in this semester and truly hope to improve my programming skills. 

Besides programming, I have always been an animal lover. I'm very interested in reptiles such as snakes, leopard geckos and many different kinds of lizards. Playing and handling friendly snakes such as corn snakes are definitely not as scary as it seems. My favourite snake is the ball python because of its shy and friendly personality. During my summer break, I worked in a reptile store and really enjoyed every second of it there. I have learnt so much more about reptiles and other exotic animals and was lucky enough to have the chance to feed them all. 

I also have involved myself very much in music. I've started playing the piano since I was 3 and finished my Grade 8 ABRSM exam last year. I was also a bass trombone player in my school band during my high school years. In the future, I would love to learn the saxophone as I love jazz. Besides music, I also enjoy drawing and painting during my free time.
